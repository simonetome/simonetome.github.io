<h2>Project</h2>

This is an implementation of a simplified Arkanoid-like game with WebGl2 for the Computer Graphics course @ PoliMi (professor Gribaudo).

<h3>Features</h3>

- Directional light (color/directions can be changed real-time);
- Point light (color/decay/position can be changed real-time);
- Camera (position and view direction can be changed real-time);
- Camera-shading space;
- Scene graph is used to draw the scene (except the SkyBox);
- Multiple shaders: for Objects with Lambert reflection & None/Phong specular and for SkyBox;
- Modular code: an object to draw is a class and we can set textures/mesh/shaders;
- Animations for both the ball and paddle are smoothed;
- Game can be started/restarted freely;
- Audio loop and sound effects;
